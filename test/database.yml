# To modify the test database parameters, create a new file called
# local_database.yml and go nuts with settings. The "jdbc" settings
# are merged into the "arunit" settings as JDBC works over a TCP
# socket and those sorts of connections generally require some user
# credentials.

arunit:
  adapter: "postgresql"
  database: "postgresql_extensions_unit_tests"
  min_messages: "warning"
  schema_search_path: "public"

jdbc:
  host: "localhost"
  adapter: "jdbcpostgresql"
